            <h2>Our Inspiration</h2>
            <p>
              Shashvat, a sweet little boy with big dreams. He wanted to become
              a Paediatric Oncologist. He did well in whatever that came to his
              plate in his little lifetime. Be it in his Academics or Roller
              Skating, Table Tennis, Swimming and lately playing piano, he was
              good at everything. He had many friends with whom he played, but
              “Tanmay” was his best friend, the only one he missed a lot in his
              last days.
            </p>
            <p>
              As parents we were so proud of him. He was our Shravan Kumar, who
              even in his last days, thought about his parents and expressed his
              gratitude by telling us how lucky he was to get parents like us.
              However, it was the other way round. For us he is still with us.
              He was and is in true sense SHASHVAT (eternal).
            </p>
            <p>
              As a child he was very soft spoken, obedient and wonderful kid,
              but the other side of his personality was full of kindness and
              empathy, especially towards the underprivileged ones. At the age
              of 12 he expressed his wish to help children with critical illness
              and support their families through variable means, a virtue very
              rarely seen especially at his tender age. This probably came to
              him because he himself had gone through the sufferings and had a
              fair idea of what a family goes through during the treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
              As parents, we have witnessed the helplessness and agony a family
              goes though when you see your child in pain and suffering. Every
              family in such case tries to provide the best treatment available
              despite being drained out emotionally and financially. Unlike well
              off families, the underprivileged families also need to take care
              of the means to feed their family over and above the treatment
              expenses. Shashvat understood this at very tender age.
            </p>
            <p>
              As per Shashvat’s last wish, SHASHVAT PAEDIATRIC CARE FOUNDATIION
              (SPCF) was founded to take care of critically ill children. SPCF
              is committed to provide financial assistances to all such children
              who are coming from underprivileged families. It was formed with
              an aim that family should focus only on the children, without
              worrying about the financial part of the treatment. As a part of
              this initiative, SPCF has collaborated with National Cancer
              Institute, Nagpur and Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai and trying to
              serve the children and families through any such opportunities
              created.
